This repo is the work of a man in despair. Why "despair", you ask? Because very few seasoned programmers explore DApp games to their full extent.

Ergo, despite not knowing how to write a Hello World program without googling the solution, here I am. 

Enjoy looking through this mess of basic HTML/CSS/JS. No Typescript, jQuery or node.js - too rich for my blood.

Some guidance:
1) "test_xxx" files refer to older test versions. "betaX" are the most recent files (beta4 as of the time of this writing)
2) abi_* holds the smart contract ABI, generated with Remix IDE: https://remix.ethereum.org/
3) ethers-v4.min.js is the excellent ethers.js library used to interact with everything Ethereum: https://docs.ethers.io/ethers.js/html/
4) simpleNotification.js is a lightweight notification library: https://github.com/Glagan/SimpleNotification
5) eggforce_logic_* has all the javascript for the eggforce website, in one glorious ~2000 lines file ignoring every best practice known to man
